An anki add-on that delays all cards by the number of days the deck is overdue.

FOR EXAMPLE:
If you have not studied for 2 weeks, it will delay all cards by 14 days - essentially making it as though you never missed a day.

# Usage
Click on the gear icon for the specific deck you want to delay. Choose delay option in the menu.
