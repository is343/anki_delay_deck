An anki add-on that delays all cards by the number of days the deck is overdue.

This add-on will delay all of the cards based on the MOST overdue card. So for example, if one card was overdue by 60 days but the rest by 3 days, they would all be delayed by 60 days.

FOR EXAMPLE:
If you have not studied for 2 weeks, it will delay all cards by 14 days - essentially making it as though you never missed a day.

# Usage
Click on the gear icon for the specific deck you want to delay. Choose delay option in the menu.

# Caution
Please be careful to not get into the habit of constantly delaying cards instead of studying.
